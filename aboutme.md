subtitle: Baseball and Analytics, both are my passion!

My name is Daniel Hern√°ndez and I spend my free time analyzing baseball feats.
I use [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Circos](www.circos.ca).

This is my blog mainly for analysis performed in R.

Previous articles on Tableau Public and Circos remain in my previous [blog](http://graficosymetricas.wordpress.com).
