subtitle: Baseball and Analytics, both are my passion!
---

My name is Daniel Hern√°ndez. I spend my free time analyzing baseball feats, curiosities, records and statistics about baseball.

Baseball is one of the sports where almost everything is measured and, since some years ago, much of that information is available in the Internet. Nevertheless, that info is mainly available in the format of tables, which is a very good way to show total values or specific metrics, but it doesn't show trends or any other interesting insights that can be found with graphs. On that sense, one of my main goals on my analysis is to visualize information that cannot be found easily on that raw baseball data.

I use [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Circos](www.circos.ca) as tools to document those analysis.

This is my blog mainly for analysis performed in R, which I made available through github repositories.

I've performed articles before using Tableau Public and Circos, but they are kept still on my previous [blog](http://graficosymetricas.wordpress.com).
